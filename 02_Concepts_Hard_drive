BTRFS - Use on the "OS" Disk to allow me to rollback changes (I do something dumb and I can go back a week or 4)
MERGERFS - make multiple drives appear as one
SNAPRAID - make regular (daily?) parity, this will allow for one drive failure without losing more than 1 days data.


5 Drives:
 0) Boot (BTRFS)
 1) NTFS    1 TB SSD  "Copy of most important files" - this is a FUSE Clone (ChironFS) or rSync copy of all my most important files
            I can take this drive out any time I want and put in a USB case to view these files on a Windows computer 
 2) Data #1 2 TB HDD  (EXT4 or BTRFS)
 3) Data #2 2 TB HDD  (EXT4 or BTRFS)
 4) Data #3 2 TB HDD  (EXT4 or BTRFS)
 5) Parity
