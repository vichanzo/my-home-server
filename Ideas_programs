# File server features
- do not want RAID (main benefits from striping to get speed come with drawbacks I don't want)
- I want to be able to take any drive out and put on a different computer and still access my files (OK if some minor config is needed)
- I don't want my files to be at risk if my RAID controller or SW RAID gets messed up.  
- I want some resiliency in case a hard drive fails (use Snap RAID or similar) so that I can keep running if one drive fails (no or minimal data loss)
- I want some protection from my own stupid mistakes and ability to roll back changes (run BTFS or similar with sanpshots)
- Make at least 2 copies of the most important files (one copy on a different drive)

Most important files: (one copy on Merged pool, one copy on NTFS SSD)
 - Photos and "Home Videos"
 - Tax files / financial documents
 - Personal documents (word docs, xl, other projects)

Medium importance:
 - files ripped from my personal DVD's and CD's
 - VM's and Backups of other computers (the data is most important)

Least important files:
 - software downloaded from the internet
 - Media downloaded (movies and music)
